			<b>INFO</b><br>
			Humphrey Jermaine N. Arciaga <br>
			17 years old<br>
			Grew up in Muntinlupa City.<br><br>
            <b>Hobbies<br></b>
            - Playing Games<br>
            - Listening to Music<br>
            - Playing Guitar<br><br>
            <b>Specialization<br></b>
            - I specialize in English quite a bit and Science, because my dream job is to become a Computer Hardware Engineer so I need to do well in that paritcular subject, and a little bit of Mathematics.
            Also, I'm good at playing games; especially first person shooter games like CSGO and Valorant. I also specialize in fixing hardware like the components of a computer, and also researching. I can also think critically and remain calm even when under pressure.<br><br>
            <b>Finding My Dream Job<br></b>
            - I found out about my dream job when I'm just casually playing games and messing and tweaking some programs in my computer to make the game run as smooth as possible, because the games and most of the
            programs I want to use can't be ran properly by the computer. No matter how many times I tweak its settings, I was not able to run it smoothly. Then I found out that, it was not the software of the system, but the hardware that is outdated, mainly its components which are the CPU, GPU, etc.
            The reason why I wanted to become a Computer Hardware Engineer is to be able to make components or parts of a computer hardware that is capable of running almost 99% of all programs or games that can be found on the internet without any lag nor delay in the computer, as all the components that I will make would rival most of the hardware that these giant tech companies make.<br><br>
            <b>Quote in Life</b><br>
            - "Only a mind free of impediment is capable of grasping the chaotic beauty of the world. This is our greatest asset."
