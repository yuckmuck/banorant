			<b>DREAM</b><br>
			My dream is to become an airline pilot from the company of my choice someday. Since I want to travel with my family and make memories with them. In order for me to achieve
			my dream I must work hard and persevere. I will make my parents proud and show them the time and effort they gave into raising me has paid off. It would be one of the happiest
			moments of my life if my parents see me succeed in life.<br><br>
			<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
			I was born on August 2, 2003 in Masbate City. Most of my childhood we lived in Masbate and I met plenty of my friends there. We moved to Muntinlupa and I never got in touch with my old friends ever since.
			But I also met a lot of great people here in Muntinlupa. We used to play a lot since I was a very energetic child back then. As time passes by I became more mature and serious about life. My perspective, the way
			I think and act as well. But I realized that life is too short to be serious all the time. Which is why I put myself at ease and let go of my problems. Since stressing about it and worrying will not make it go away.
			And I now realize that we should always be happy and look at the positive things in life.
